# Biomedical Text Generation using Modern NLP Techniques

This repository contains the code and resources for a final-year thesis project at the University of Patras, Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics.  
The aim is to build a biomedical text generation system using modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT, T5, and BioGPT.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Collect biomedical data from PubMed and related sources.
- Preprocess and structure the data for different tasks (summarization, QA, generation).
- Fine-tune pretrained transformer models on domain-specific biomedical tasks.
- Evaluate output quality both quantitatively and manually.
- Deploy the model or evaluate in a testbed setup.
